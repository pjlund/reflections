What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing repository prepares a .git file which will contain your commit history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area contains all of the changes in the working directory that the user would like to put in a single commit to the repository. It allows the user an extra degree of control when managing commits.
