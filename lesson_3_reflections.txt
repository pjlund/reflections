When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for backing your work up and for making your work accessible from many locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling allows you to pull at logical points. Automatic pulling may put your code into a state which can't be compiled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are multiple code bases on a single machine. Clones are the same repository on different machines. Forks are clones internally on Github's machines.
