When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are useful for backing your work up and for making your work accessible from many locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manually pulling allows you to pull at logical points. Automatic pulling may put your code into a state which can't be compiled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches are multiple code bases on a single machine. Clones are the same repository on different machines. Forks are clones internally on Github's machines.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows offline merging that is not rushed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We could collaborate by keeping our own copies of files and merging them ourselves when necessary. The upside to this type of collaboration is that there is less overhead to learn first.
